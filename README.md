Hello, 
my Name is Luis and i live in Stuttgart.
I have a bit programming, eletronic and computer knowledge, but i never used it really in practice.

So i would like to learn GitHub to see some codes maybe from other people.

I am 24 years old and i am currently in a rehabilitation facility.

Thank you

Luis Galvez Bommer
